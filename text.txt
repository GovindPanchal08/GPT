Separation of Concerns

Controllers → Handle requests/responses

Services → Business logic

Data Layer → DB operations only

Horizontal Scaling

Use PM2 clustering to run multiple Node processes

Load balancer distributes requests

Performance Optimizations

Redis for caching heavy DB queries

Message queue for async tasks (don’t block HTTP request)

Use streaming for large file/data handling

Security Layers

API Gateway → Request validation, throttling

JWT & API keys for auth

Input sanitization & HTTPS everywhere

Environment-based configs & secret vaults

Resilience

Retry logic & circuit breakers

Graceful shutdown

Health checks & monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
